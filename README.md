# customer-segmentation-kmeans-model
Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering This project applies unsupervised machine learning to segment customers based on their annual income and spending behavior. Using the K-Means clustering algorithm, the dataset is grouped into 5 distinct clusters, ranging from Budget Keepers to Premium Elites. This segmentation can help businesses.

# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how **K-Means clustering** can be used for **customer segmentation** based on **annual income** and **spending score**.  
By applying unsupervised learning, we identify **five unique customer groups**, which businesses can leverage for **better decision-making, targeted marketing, and customer relationship management**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand customer behavior through clustering.
- Segment customers into distinct groups.
- Visualize clusters for better interpretation.
- Provide insights for business strategy and marketing.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset contains customer data with attributes such as:
  - **CustomerID**
  - **Annual Income**
  - **Spending Score**
- This is similar to the popular *Mall Customers dataset* often used in clustering demos.

## 🧠 Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Applying **K-Means Clustering**
4. Finding the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method** & **Silhouette Score**
5. Visualizing customer segments
6. Interpreting the clusters with descriptive names:
   - **Budget Keepers**
   - **Occasional Spenders**
   - **Steady Shoppers**
   - **Value Maximizers**
   - **Premium Elites**

---

## 📈 Results
- Customers were successfully divided into **5 segments**.
- Clear patterns were observed between **income levels** and **spending behavior**.
- Visualizations illustrate how clusters differ in size and characteristics.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

📌 Future Improvements
	•	Try other clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering.
	•	Include more customer features (e.g., age, gender, region).
	•	Deploy as a web app for interactive segmentation.
